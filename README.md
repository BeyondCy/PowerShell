Best Practices and Style Guide
-------------------

The [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide][] by the folks over at PoshCode is a fairly decent document-in-progress.  I've come to many of the same conclusions as they have the hard way, so save yourself some time and give it a quick read over if you haven't already.

-------------------

PowerShell is licensed under the [MIT license][].  I've chosen to do the same with my own unofficial cmdlets and scripts.
