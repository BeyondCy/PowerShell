====================

This is my repository for PowerShell scripts and functions I've created that I think others will find useful.

Best Practices and Style Guide
-------------------

The [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide][] by the folks over at PoshCode is a fairly decent document-in-progress.  I've come to many of the same conclusions as they have the hard way, so I recommend you save yourself some time and give it a quick read over if you haven't already.  My code won't always adhere to it, but I haven't gotten around to writing a style guide for how I teach people to PowerShell.

Cmdlet Development Guidelines
-------------------

MSDN has solid documentation on how to build real cmdlets, found in their [Required Development Guidelines][], [Strongly Encouraged Development Guidelines][], and [Advisory Development Guidelines][].  Ususally when I make a 'cmdlet' its really just an advanced function.  Long term I plan and turning the more useful of these into real cmdlets.  If you want to learn more about how to do so yourself check out the [Writing a Windows PowerShell Cmdlet][] MSDN article.
